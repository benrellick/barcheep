# Barcheep

This is (was) a website for finding happy hours locally. I made it in like 2013 since none of the bars in town were legally allowed to list their happy hours anywhere and I wanted a way to keep track of them (and thought it'd be a fun project).

This is a backup from May 6th, 2017. I'm going to put this online and then figure out how to better structure things. Then I might build this out to the point that I orginally wanted to â€“ to make it easy for users to add cities, bars, and specials, and to create a way to filter through this information and flag the innaccurate stuff / filter what you want to see or trust.

Anyway, here it is.
